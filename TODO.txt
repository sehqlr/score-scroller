ScoreScroller TODO:

1. Analyze the source code. It might be helpful to write down each
	JS object on an index card and try to piece the functions together

2. Contact the score-library developers. See if they can give
	any insight into how the code works or get ideas on implementing
	the project

3. Once the code is understood, and any help from the developers is given,
	then we need to add in the scrolling function. It may be as simple as
	having the sheet music scroll horizontally. Depending
	on how the code works, this part may be easy

4. Once the basic scrolling functionality is finished, the app is at
	version 0.5! This would be a good time to celebrate a little

5. Obtain ten or so scores to demo with the app. Make sure we get the
	MusicXML files

6. Change the User Input controls to fit our program

7. Create the server setup to host the app

8. Pretty it up with web design.

9. Bugfixes

10. Ship it as version 1.0!
